# WebGL-Utils
Basic utility functions and classes to make working with fullscreen pixel shaders in WebGL more streamlined<br/><br/>
A lot of more 3D-oriented elements may be missing (such as setting uniform matrices or a default cube shader) as I made this primarily for working with pixel shaders and didn't care about projection matrices.<br/>
